A piece for six speakers and a room microphone.

A farily simple system is presented, where six small speakers emit an impulse in succession while a microphone listens for their impulse. If the microphone hears the speaker's impulse, it moves immediately to the next speaker, if not, the speaker "times out" before moving to the next speaker.

The primary parameters of the piece are the speakers' orientation, their distance from the microphone, and presence of objects blocking the speakers.

quality of the system
=====================
Generally, it takes around 43 milliseconds for the impulse to be processed by the system when the speaker and microphone are 1 meter apart. With the speed of sound being approximately 343 meters per second, it should only take around 3 milliseconds for sound to cover 1 meter. So while rhythmic and tonal changes occur due to the proximity of the speakers to the microphone, these changes are subtle compared to the electronic system slowing the overall process down.

The quality of the microphone and speaker cables, the quality of the sound card and dac used, the quality of the speakrs and microphone themselves, and the acoustics of the space all contribute to how fast the system reacts. The initial version presented uses a Focusrite Scarlett 18i, Boss 4" car stereo speakers, Lepy 24W two channel amplifiers, an ISEMCOM measurement microphone, and a 2015 Macbook Pro.
