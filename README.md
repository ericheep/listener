A piece for six speakers and a room microphone.

The six small speakers emit an impulse in succession, with a mic listening for their impulse. If the microphone hears the speaker's impulse, it moves immediately to the next speaker, if not, the speaker "times out" before moving to the next speaker. That piece is formed by the the changing speaker configurations, which consists of tthe speakers' orientation and distance from the room microphone.
